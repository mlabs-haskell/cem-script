# Design principles

## Why Cardano DApp modeling language is important?

While prototypes can be easily constructed with existing Cardano frameworks, making it secure and production ready is sisyphean task.

We believe, that onchain PL improvements by themselves could not change that. Only higher-level modeling framework can lead to reliable DApp production.

In following enumerate our high-level design goals
and demonstrate them by list of specific problems
arising in existing DApps codebase.
Such problems are specific security vulnerabilities types
and various kinds development, audit and support cost increase.
After that we examine how existing solutions
are covering our high-level goals.

## High-level goals

1. DApp logic as whole (synced-by-construction)
2. Code is free from common security weaknesses by construction (secure-by-construction)
3. Seamlessly emulate and test anything (emulate-anything)
4. Being declarative: close to informal specification and bridging lightweight formal methods (declarative-spec)
5. Generally production ready (production-ready)

## Not in scope at all

* Composable inter-DApp interactions and DApp migrations
* Scheduled actions

## Not in scope for current Catalyst funding

* CTL and overall frontend transaction construction model
* No specific support, but can be added manually
  * Metadata, reference scripts and non-inlined datums
  * Stacking and governance features (apart for (security-by-default))
  * ZK-proofs

# Details of examples of problems to be solved

## Reference apps

Those are list of open-source DApps,
what we use to demonstrate problems in following:

* Audited production DApps
  * Agora
  * MinSwap
  * Fracada
  * JPG Vesting Contract
  * Indigo Protocol
* DApp projects we participated, audited or otherwise know their codebase
  * Hydra Auction
  * POCRE
  * CNS
  * Hydra
* Plutonomicon patterns
* plutus-usecases

## On-chain correctness

### Known common vulnerabilities

There is a list of known security vulnerabilities,
for which naive Plutus implementation is very often prone to.
Our implementation makes them impossible to happen,
taking that burden from developers and auditors.

* Double satisfaction
  * Shown twice in CNS Audit
  * Shown once in Fracada audit (3.2.7)
* Insufficient staking control
  * Shown once in CNS Audit - https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/cns-plutus-audit/issues/24

### TxIn ordering and coin change support

Those problems are similar to previous in that they tend to
arise in naive Plutus implementations,
if developer was did not take measures to prevent them.

Plutus forces developers to write TxIn/TxOut constraints from scratch,
leading by subtle bugs from copy-pasting logic or
trying to optimize them by hand.

Examples:

* Security bug in MinSwap audit - 2.2.1.3 Unauthorized Hijacking of Pools Funds
* Non-security bug in MinSwap audit - 2.2.2.2 Batcher Is Not Allowed to Apply Their Own Order

Such constraints naturally lead to conditions
for which more performant implementation should
omit some constraints always following from others.
Such kind of manual SMT solving exercises are
known source for security bugs and complicated code.

One of important cases is maintaining invariants of token value.
TODO - add explanation

Most of transactions which require fungible tokens as input,
should not depend from exact UTxO coin-change distribution.

Failure to expect that leads to prohibition of correct transactions.
On other side too broad constraint might lead to fund stealing.

Example of bugs:

* https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/hydra-auction/issues/146

Making Plutus contract invariant to `TxIn` ordering
and participation in multi-script scenarios lead to
similar kind of complications.

Examples:

* Non-security bug: https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/hydra-auction/issues/129
* Non-security bug: https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/hydra-auction/commit/8152720c43732f8fb74181b7509de503b8371997
* Non-intentionally under-specified behavior in MinSwap audit:
  * `2.2.2.1 Batchers Can Choose Batching Order`
  * Triggered by `2.2.4.1 "Reliance on Indexes Into ScriptContexts' txInputs and txOutputs"`
* Multiple kind of code complication was observed in CNS audit.

### Single script safety and liveliness

Main feature of any correct application is that it
behave same as it specification presumes. In our case
specification for single script is CEM state machine,
and correctness means that on-chain script have exactly
same transitions possible.

On-chain script having transition not possible in model
usually leads to security vulnerability. Other way around
it might be DoS vulnerability or just usability bug.
We aim to check most of such problems automatically.
Almost all on-chain code bugs are specific cases of
such violations, at least once we are analyzing
not single script, but whole DApp, which is covered
in next section.

One very important example of liveliness violation
is originated from Cardano Tx limits. Such kind
of bugs are very hard to detect, without transaction fuzzing.
Such fuzzing can be automated as part of our testing framework.
Moreover similar task of script usecase benchmarking
can be covered by same automation. Such kind of benchmarking,
either on list of scenarios or arbitrary generated inputs
is essential for checking economics and performance regressions of DApp.

https://plutus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/writing-scripts/common-weaknesses/index.html

### Multiple script safety and liveliness

Whole DApp may be modeled as another kind of state-machine.
It operates on level of whole DApp and generates specific script transitions. Liveliness could be checked by `quickcheck-dynamic`,
or providing specific usecases just as single script case.

Safety checks is harder to automate. This is not in the scope of current Catalyst project it is possible to cover this case as well
by employing constraint equivalence check,
and verifying that any deviation from generated transitions
is not possible. Another solution might be mutation testing.
Such kind of vulnerabilities are now the most complex kind of attack
to consider as part of DApp design or auditing.
Thus, automating it may be beneficial.

### Time and stages handling

Plutus time is described by allowed intervals.
Such abstraction is prone to off-by-one and similar kind of errors.
At least three errors of this kind are known in Cardano/Plutus
interval logic, showing that this is not simple to implement
correctly.

Another problem is keeping time logic in sync between on-
and off-chain code. This is even more hard given that Plutus time
to slot conversion is not obvious to implement correctly.
Slot time differences and overall need to make test cases match
real blockchain behavior may lead to flaky test behavior.

Our script stages abstraction cover all those kind of problems.

* @todo #3: document problems with slots in Plutus/Cardano API
  * https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/hydra-auction/issues/236

## Matching off-chain logic

Problem of duplicating logic between on- and off-chain is twofold.
Testing is essentially offchain, thus, you may miss that your onchain code
is not actually enforcing part of Tx provided in tests.

CEM Script is constructing Tx for submission from same specification,
which is used for onchain script. Thus it is much harder to miss constraint
to be checked.

Examples:

* MinSwap audit - 2.2.1.2 LP Tokens Can Be Duplicated

## Logic duplication and spec subtleness

### Human-readable specification

Designing, understanding and auditing any non-trivial DApp
is almost impossible without human-readable spec.
That is why in all reference DApps either used spec in development,
or was asked to provide specification by auditor.
Tweag and MLabs audits specifically list validating provided specification
as one of main tasks of audit.

This leads to lot of cruft with writing, linking and updating specifications. Quite often not only one, but up to three levels of spec granularity would be beneficial for project, which worsens situation.
We observe great amount of cruft and spec rot in all projects we were personally involved. Such kind of cruft is often present
not only on level of single developers, but on communication

Such kind of human-readable specs are very much similar to our model,
they almost always include enumeration of possible transitions
and/or state-machine diagrams.
Our project will generate such kind of specifications automatically
as Markdown file with Mermaid diagrams.
Adding usecases scenarios generated from one specified in tests
is much less obvious to implement,
and out of scope of current Catalyst project,
but it is very much possible feature as well.

Examples of diagrams in DApp specifications:

* ...
* ...
* ...

### On-/Off-chain and spec logic duplication

Writing on-chain contracts manually encodes non-deterministic state machine,
which cannot be used for off-chain transaction construction.
Thus developer need to write them again in different style in off-chain code,
which is tedious and error prone.

They should add checks for all errors possible,
like coins being available and correct script states being present,
to prevent cryptic errors and provide retrying strategies
for possible utxo changes.

Our project encodes scripts in deterministic machine,
containing enough information to construct transaction automatically.
This also gives a way to check for potential on/off-chain logic differences
semi-automatically.

Example:
* MinSwap Audit - 2.2.4.3 Large Refactoring Opportunities
* `availableVestings` - пример чего-то подобного для SimpleAuction

@todo #3: Add more off-chain code duplication examples from existing PABs.
    Include problems with querying coin-selection, tests, retrying and errors.

Timing ...


### Common backend features

There is a list of common tasks shared by multiple backends,
which could be tackled generically in our framework.

* Parsing transaction back to state-machine transition
  is required for delegated architectures,
  including almost any DApp on Hydra L2.
* Customized transaction indexing is important for providing
  data to almost any kind of custom web-backend.
  Also usage of customized indexing may reduce storage space or SaaS dependence for DApp dependent on old transactions being recorded.
  Our framework simplifies generation of custom indexing solution,
  based on transition parsing feature.
* Script hashes and sizes summary is essential
  for DApp users and testers to check on-chain script are matching.

# Existing solutions

## Backends

### PAB

PABs state-machines and `plutus-contract-model` package
are the ony existing project close to our design.

They are providing CEM state machine model script,
translatable to on-chain and off-chain code.
On top of that you may specify custom `ContractModel`
specifying multi-script DApp as a whole,
and model check your custom invariants and
very generic "CrashTolerance" safety property
and "No Locked Funds" liveliness property.
Thus they are the only project known to us,
which aim to cover (declarative-spec) and (synced-by-construction) goals.

This model is generic and covered in Plutus Pioneer tutorial,
thus already known to many people.
Our design is based on very similar model.
Unfortunately, existing `plutus-apps` solution seem to be completely
not (production-ready). We could not find any `ContractModel` usage example on github, apart from forks and tutorials, thus it does not seem that it is indeed not much used in practice.
Also they provide much less free guaranties and features then we aim to.
As we will demonstrate in sequel,
this is most probably impossible to fix without changing PAB design.

State Machine to on-chain translation is very naive
and would not produce optimal code in multiple typical cases.
Constraint language used by PAB is fundamentally more expressible than ours,
and that complicates possibility of implementing required optimizations.
Specifics of those design considerations are detailed in arch documentation.

Same logic stands for (security-by-default) goal,
in particular providing SMT encoding for constrains,
which may be used to drastically shrink model-check fuzzing space
or even completely remove a need to use fuzzing.
Automatic check for various other important security properties,
like almost-determinism is complicated by this as well.

Another important restriction,
is that PAB state machines always produce state-thread-token contract.
This makes impossible to encode tree like UTxO based data-structures,
which are used for encoding all kinds of public registry logic.
Also it prohibits any kind of non-trivial state-thread-token logic,
like optimization by sharing (used for example in `hydra-auction`)
and multiple commiters schemes (used in `hydra`).

@todo #3: Write more about PAB issues with emulator, packaging and Plutus

### Atlas

Atlas provides more humane DX on top of cardano-api.
But it has no features related to goals
(synced-by-construction), (secure-by-construction)
and (declarative-spec).
(emulate-everything) is planned, but is not implemented currently.

Atlas includes connectors to Blockfrost and other backends,
which our project lacks.

Also our project has slight differences in API design decisions.
Our monad interfaces is meant to be slightly more modular.
We use much less custom type wrappers, resorting to Plutus types where possible.


## Testing tools

### Tweag's cooked-validators

Project definitely covers goal (production-ready),
because it was successfully used in real-world audits.
but only partially covers
(emulate-anything) and (declarative-spec) goals.

While it, surely, can do transaction emulation,
it, to best of our knowledge, does not have monad instance
for real L1 blockchain. So you still cannot reuse same code
across tests and real blockchain Tx construction.

`TxSkel` datatype is similar to design we are implementing,
and other parts API have a lot of cool DX decisions.
But `cooked-validators` lack script transition model,
so it cannot provide declarative Tx submission error handling
we aim to get, because it does not have information to decide,
if specific Tx input is critical (like auth token),
or can be re-selected again (like coin-selected ADA for payment).

Having declarative transition model is even
more important for mutation testing purposes.
`cooked-validators` gives Cardano Tx level API,
for construction of mutations.
That means, that you should select, write and evaluate
them manually, depending on logic of your script.
This lead to logic coupling between spec, L1 code and test code.
Such coupling and overall manual construction
complicates spec validation and might lead
to attack vectors missed by mistake.

Our API presumes that means of on-script validation,
in our case behavior equivalence (aka bi-similarity)
of declarative CEM state-machine and real on-chain script
is verified and validated semi-automatically.
Also we plan to make some kind of vulnerabilities covered by
`cooked-validators` impossible by construction, specifically modules:
`ValidityRange`, `DoubleSat`, `AddInputsAndOutputs`
and `OutPermutations`.

Another important feature is support for LTL logic formulas,
which are known language for specifying state transitions in BMC.
It seems like this feature is subsumed by
`quickcheck-dynamic` based model checking specification
we are going to provide.

### Hydra Mutations

Hydra mutations are similar to cooked-validators in their design
and have similar drawback. Thus they do not cover (synced-by-construction), (secure-by-construction)
and (declarative-spec) goals.

https://abailly.github.io/posts/mutation-testing.html

### tasty-plutus

Only cover (emulate-anything) goal, does not aim to cover others.
Is deprecated as well.
But it has some interesting low-level features,
like `plutus-size-check`, which code we would probably steal.

### General Haskell verification tools

We plan to use first two tools in our implementation.
They both are tested in real projects and documented well.

Other tools are not applicable to our project.

1. quickcheck-dynamic
2. [SBV](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/sbv)
3. apropos
4. Liquid Haskell
5. Agda

## On-chain PLs and CIP-30 wrappers

Any kind of on-chain PL can only cover goals
(emulate-anything) and (production-readiness).
As far as we aware, none of them are trying
to solve other goals.

Known examples:

* Aiken
* Helios
* https://github.com/OpShin/opshin
* PureScript Backend project

Same stands for any known kind of frontend framework:

* CTL
* Lucid
* meshjs.dev

Same stands for any kind of `cardano-api` API translation to other PLs:

* PyCardano - https://pycardano.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/plutus.html
* Cardano multi-platform Lib

## Manual formalizations

* CEM-machines
* Manual Djed formalization with Kind 2/Lustre model
