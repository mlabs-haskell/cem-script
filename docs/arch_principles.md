# Constraints design

## Principles

* Generic compilation across:
    * on-chain code
    * offchain Tx construction
    * indexing backend
* Simple normalization and SMT conversion for:
    * Equivalence checking
    * Bi-simulation checking
* Constraints determine TxIn/Outs up to UTxO coin-selection (we call it almost-determinacy)
* Datum properties encoded as class types
* Common on-chain optimizations are performed if possible
    * Constraints normalization, and CSE
    * Best error short-cutting
    * Common security problems prevention

## Potential obstacles

* Ease and optimality of backend compilation
* Robustness of SMT conversion and overall normalization
* Possibility for parsing and correct offchain usage of almost-determinacy
* Having enough information for Tx submit retrying strategies
* Design for using custom Datum properties is not obvious

# CEM machine design

As it is done on top of constraints language,
all their principles and obstacles are affecting CEM as well.

## Principles

* State-machine is deterministic modulo coin-change
* Transaction can always be parsed back into SM transitions
* Potential non-deterministic on-chain optimizations should not affect this principle.

## Potential obstacles

* Some scripts inexpressible by such model (as it happens in PAB)
* Sub-optimal code from deterministic transitions model
